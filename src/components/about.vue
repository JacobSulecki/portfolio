    <h1 class=" text-4xl sm:text-6xl text-center pb-10">About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am Jacob, a young and aspiring Developer! I come from an aircraft Avionics systems background from the United States Air Force (USAF). 
        Here I worked for 6 years collaborating with many teams comprising of fellow service members and civilian contractors/engineers alike.
        My main job was to maintain key systems to ensure mission readiness and success. Though this does not directly 
        involve the development of software, I do believe the skills I learned along the way invaluably correspond to my future as a software engineer.

        At 4evermore LLC, our e-commerce platform thrives thanks to my role in its development and maintenance, 
        leveraging my skills in full-stack development. My journey began with a solid Computer Science foundation 
        from American Military University, leading to a hands-on, problem-solving approach in my work.
        The expertise fostered during my tenure as an Avionics Specialist for the USAF 
        has been invaluable when it comes to communication, problem solving, and system integration. With the addition
        of a CompTIA Security+ certification, I've successfully integrated cybersecurity principles into web development, 
        enhancing our digital solutions' reliability and fostering a intuitive user experience.
